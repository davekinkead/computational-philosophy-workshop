### Computational Philosophy Workshop

# Simulation, Segregation, and Game Theory

Last workshop, we created an agent based simulation of segregation effects based on Thomas Schelling's 1969 work.

This week, we are going to add some more complexity to our models by incorporating game theory.  The workshop will largely be a reproduction of [this paper][grim] by Patrick Grimn so you'll need to read that and brush up on [some basic][wiki] [game theory][sep].

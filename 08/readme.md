# Information Cascades

An information cascade is a description rational choice when agents can see what others do but not what they know.  As [Ivo Welch](http://info-cascades.ivo-welch.info/) defines it:

> An information cascade is a situation in which every subsequent actor, based on the observations of others, makes the same choice independent of his/her private signal.

[Background Reading](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/networks-book-ch16.pdf)

So consider the following hypothetical:

> Alice, Bob, & Charlie are independently trying to decide where to dine on their first night out in a new city.  They have a choice between two restaurants - Thai or Indian - and are indifferent between cuisines.  They do know that one is definitely better than the other but only know with some certainty (66%) which one that is.  Alice chooses first, then Bob then Charlie.  Later diners see earlier ones choose and they all know that each has the same credence for the correct choice.
>
> If Bob privately thinks Indian is the better choice but Alice chooses Thai, then it is rational (if Bob is a good little Bayesian) for him to update his belief in light of Alice's choice.


Erroneous Mass Behavior: In an information cascades everyone is individually acting rationally. Still, even if all participants as a collective have overwhelming information in favor of the correct action, each and every participant may take the wrong action. The probability that everyone is taking the wrong action is less than 50%, but it is easy to construct examples in which everyone is wrong with 30-40% probability.

Fragility: A little bit of public information (or an unusual signal) can overturn a long-standing informational cascades. That is, even though a million people may have chosen one action, seemingly little information can induce the next million people to choose the opposite action. Fragility is an integral component of the Informational cascades theory!


From Wikipedia:

Agents make decisions sequentially
Agents make decisions rationally based on the information they have
Agents do not have access to the private information of others
A limited action space exists (e.g. an adopt/reject decision)

Results....


What we've seen is .....

- uniform connectiveity with random distribution of belief and a truth bias in updating results in truth propagation 
- random connectivity with random distribution of belief and a truth bias results in islands of ignorance.
- uniform connectivity with a clustered distribution of belief and truth bias results in entrenched clustering of belief.
- uniform connectivity with random distribution of belief and a bayesian update results in large clusters of belief.
- random connectivity with random distribution of belief and a bayesian update results in small clusters of belief.
- uniform connectivity and high segregation of belief and a bayesian update results in complete dominance of belief (latter beliefs dominating)

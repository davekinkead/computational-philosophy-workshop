# Code that's Nasty, Brutish, and Short


		Nature::state () ->
			["solitary", "poore", "nasty", "brutish", "short"]


This week we dive into political theory with an examination of Hobbes' state of nature.  Hobbes' major project, according to [Lloyd & Sreedha][sep], was to "discover rational principles for the construction of a civil polity that would not be subject to destruction from within."

Hobbes thought that any political authority that wasn't absolute was systematically prone to dissolution and civil war.  He was searching for an account of political stability.  In game theory terms, he was searching for a stable equilibrium. 

So what is the best payoff matrix to describe Hobbes' account of the state of nature?  Identifying one is the primary goal for this week's workshop.  We will attempt to construct a set of utility functions and player strategies that replicate a _warre of all against all_ in an evolutionary state, before exploring some other plausible stable alternatives.

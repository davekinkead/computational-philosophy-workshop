# Computational Philosophy Workshops

![It is not wisdom but an intelligible commit message that makes a law.](static/leviathan.png)

Ahoy-hoy philo-geeks!  I'm running an informal workshop on computational philosophy weekly during semester 2 starting 7 Aug 2014.

The general idea is to explore how computational methods can aid philosophical investigation, learning some agent based modelling, and get to grips with that proto game theorist extraordinaire, Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury.  Every week, we'll cover a bit of literature, hack some code, and test some foundational assumptions of political philosophy.  

The goal for the end of the semester is to have learnt enough and done sufficient research that we can have a simulation published in a journal like the [Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html).

The current plan looks something like this:

- Week #1 - Introduction & Setup
- Week #2 - Simulation, Segregation, and Game Theory
- Week #3 - Code that's Nasty, Brutish, and Short
- Week #4 - The Stag Hunt
- Week #5 - Hobbes vs Rousseau
- Week #6 - TBA

You don't need to know how to program to take part but you will need you own computer as well as a capacity to read [long run on sentences punctuated with generous helpings of semicolons](http://goo.gl/JiMJeP).  The workshops will be held somewhere TBA on campus at UQ and anyone - undergrad to staff - is welcome to attend. [RSVP on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/computationalphilosophy/).

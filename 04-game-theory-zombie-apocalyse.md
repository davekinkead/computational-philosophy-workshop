# Game Theory and the Zombie Apocalyse

Last week we started to [model some basic game theory](https://github.com/davekinkead/spatialised-prisoners-dilemma) and (eventually) succeeded in getting tit-for-tat to dominate (checkout out the [working simulation here](http://dave.kinkead.com.au/spatialised-prisoners-dilemma/)).

This week we are going to explore game theory in more depth and see how the same initial conditions lead to different outcomes for the three games thought to align most with political theory - the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Stag Hunt, and the Snow Drift.

We'll then finish up by modeling a three player game and see which strategies work best in the zombie apocalypse.
